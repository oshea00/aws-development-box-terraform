# EC2 instance for developers

## Usage
Make sure your public and private keys are in the default path or fix the default path in order to be able to login.

The default username of the instance is ubuntu, so you should ssh like this:

`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@[INSTANCE_IP] `

## TODO
- Attach docker (and maybe more apps) to instance
